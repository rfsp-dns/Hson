# Hson
Less storage then Json, almost an Yaml

## About Hson

HSON, short for Hydro Simple Object Notation, is a conceptual data format inspired by JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) but designed to be even simpler and more human-readable. Unlike JSON, which uses braces {}, brackets [], and quotes "", HSON relies on a more minimalist syntax for representing data structures. Hereâ€™s a summary of how HSON differs from JSON and how it works:

```

clothes:
  upper:
    tshirt:

  down:
    jeans :

```

### Prerequisites

For now HSON is not availanle for any type of download

### Installing

Wait please :]

## The Test

I executed a little test about storage space and I found some text storage types and the results are:

* 1st. HSON is 219KB
* 2nd. YAML is 230KB
* 3rd. JSON is 256KB
* 4th. XML is 300KB
* 5th. INI is 437KB

### Test Results

The test was conducted using a 256KB JSON file, and the content was converted into various storage formats. I performed this test to evaluate whether my custom text storage solution would use less hard drive space compared to standard formats.
