# Hson
Less storage then Json, almost an Yaml

## About Hson

HSON, short for Hydro Simple Object Notation, is a conceptual data format inspired by JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) but designed to be even simpler and more human-readable. Unlike JSON, which uses braces {}, brackets [], and quotes "", HSON relies on a more minimalist syntax for representing data structures. Hereâ€™s a summary of how HSON differs from JSON and how it works:

```
name : Stephanie
age : 20
hair :
  color : blue
  type : long, straight
eyes : blue, sometimes a little bit of ocean blue
clothes:
  upper:
    tshirt:
      color : red
    acessories : false
  down:
    jeans :
      color : black
```

### Prerequisites

For now HSON is not availanle for any type of download

### Installing

Wait please :]

## Running the tests

I executed a little test about storage space and I found some text storage types and the results are:

1st. HSON is 219KB
2nd. YAML is 230KB
3rd. JSON is 256KB
4th. XML is 300KB
5th. INI is 437KB

### Break down into end to end tests

The test was executed using a 256Kb JSON file and convert all the content for each storage type.
I executed this test to see if my own text storage will be take less storage from the hard drive.
